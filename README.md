# ðŸ¤™ Boilerplate NextJS/Firebase

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?style=flat-square&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffabiochiquezi.github.io%2F)](https://boilerplate.chiquezi.com/)

This is my boilerplate of two main frameworks that I like to use: NextJS and Firebase. However, it has a set of tools already configured such as jest, cypress, typescript... And a folder structure to facilitate the process of building the front-end of your application.

#### Motivation

Every time I was about to start a project I had to remember how to do every detail of the configuration, so I just made it easy to install and go straight to coding. Also, I structured the folders based on my own Front-end architecture principles, hope you like it.

## ðŸ“¡ Technologies / Packages

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   StyledComponents
-   TailwindCSS
-   JavaScript / Typescript
-   React / NextJS
-   Firebase
-   Firebase Emulator
-   ESLint
-   Jest
-   Cypress

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

    - cypress (e2e)
    - public
    - helpers
    - pages
        -- ...pages
        -- ...config files (routes, messages, global styles...)
        -- structure
        -- share
            --- components
            --- store
            --- types

## ðŸš€ How to run

1. **git clone** https://github.com/fabiochiquezi/ToolBoilerplate-NextFirebase.git
2. **cd** ToolBoilerplate-NextFirebase
3. **yarn install** or **npm install**
4. **yarn dev** to run. **yarn test** to unit tests. **yarn cypress** to e2e tests.

Obs: don't forget to config a firebase server if you want to use it. Put the data config in the **/pages/firebase.settings.json** file
